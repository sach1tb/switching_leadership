# Switching leadership

## Set of scripts accompanying the method described in <sup>1</sup>

### Notes
* run *tryme.m* to see how it works
* the functions *opttspart.m* performs optimal partitioning of time series and is based on <sup>2</sup>
* the functions *ete.m* and *ete_hist.m* compute transfer entropy defined in <sup>3</sup>
